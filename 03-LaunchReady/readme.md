In this phase we made low fedility prototypes of our idea and took user surveys so that our design will follow all the rules of HCI. After that we made wire frames ( high fedility prototypes) and made a video of wizard of oz. Our wizard of oz video will show the nevigation of our interface so there will be no requirement to make a nevigation design.
