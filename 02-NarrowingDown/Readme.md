Best 3 ideas:
1) The split A/B Model
2) Recorded Videos
3) Live-stream through mobile

Best Idea:
We will merge the 1st and 2nd idea into one because from storyboarding we conclude that with the split A/B Model recorded videos are also important. If we want the best type of education under hybrid system in an underpriviliged school, it cannot be done only from one model. There are conflicts whose solutions are in different models. For minimum conflicts it is best to merge different models and built a good model.
